        "description": "<p>“What is true of the oil or watercolor is equally true of the photograph,” Edward Steichen once said, aptly expressing the overt pictorial intent of <em>Rodin, Le Penseur</em>. This romantic silhouette portrait depicts Auguste Rodin seated in his studio opposite his famous work <em>Le Penseur</em>, with his sculpture of Victor Hugo in the background. In 1902, the year he made this photograph, Steichen believed he would become a painter, and he visited Rodin and his circle of artists and admirers often. But as a founding member of Alfred Stieglitz’s Photo-Secession group, Steichen increasingly created photographs that were the artistic equivalents of his paintings, in the hope of winning artistic credibility for the newer art form. Here the artist expertly manipulated the elastic and expressive gum-bichromate method, in which the application of water and brushwork in the printing process can soften or omit details, reduce dark spaces, and even change light into dark (and vice versa). The result is a combination of two separate images, both dramatically posed and lit, into a striking, painterly photograph.</p>\n<p>For more on Edward Steichen’s work in the Art Institute’s collection visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/steichen/index.html\">Edward Steichen's World War I Years</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n",

Conceived as a drinking cup, this work was destined for display on a buffet or sideboard. Kienle’s work belongs to a larger body of German Renaissance and Baroque sideboard silver that includes cups in the form of three-dimensional horses, lions, stags, and other animals. Horse-and-rider figural groups have their roots in earlier Greek and Roman sculpture. Renaissance princes often had themselves depicted in monumental form, wearing Classical dress or contemporary armor and sitting atop prancing or rearing steeds. That Kienle based this silver cup on an earlier sculptural model is suggested by the existence of a bronze group of virtually identical subject, composition, and scale, made in northern Italy during the second half of the sixteenth century. Kienle masterfully rendered the differentiation of human and equine musculature through the contrast of silver and silver-gilt surfaces, thus animating the already dynamic subject.</p>\n",

This porcelain zoo was intended for the long gallery on the main floor of the palace. By 1733, the year the king died, more than thirty different models of birds and almost forty animals had been made, many by the sculptor Johann Joachim Kändler, who worked at Meissen from 1731 to 1775. Kändler drew this vulture from life, which allowed him to animate his work with the creature’s quintessential spirit. Such porcelain animals remain the most vivid expression of Augustus’s wish, as elector and king, to possess and rule over the natural world.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Jean-François Dapcher, whose maker’s mark is on this early Neoclassical tureen, was a pupil of the great Parisian silversmith and goldsmith François-Thomas Germain (1726–1791). At the time the tureen was produced, Germain was on the run for bankruptcy, and forbidden by law from making or marking silver. This may have obliged him to leave his masterworks unsigned and opt for cover by his apprentice, Dapcher.</p>\n<p>The Stroganov coat of arms, emblem of one of the grandest Russian noble families, is prominently featured on both sides of the tureen in an oval shield. The tureen was produced for Count Alexander Sergeyevitch Stroganov, Russian ambassador to London and Naples and a renowned collector and patron of the arts. Like most Russian nobles, Count Alexander loved French culture and commissioned luxurious objects from Parisian craftsmen. Only one other piece from this dinner service is known to have survived. Beef Stroganoff must have been named for a later member of the family as the recipe first appears in a cookbook only in 1861.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>When Thomas Hope published his book <em>Household Furniture and Interior Decoration</em> in 1807, his name became forever associated with Neoclassicalism. Hope was a connoisseur and collector from a wealthy banking family of Scottish origin that moved from Amsterdam to London after the French Revolution. As a young man, he traveled extensively throughout Europe, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt, acquiring objects from all of these places, and incorporating elements from them in his design work. Hope’s wish was to shape the taste of his time by commissioning cabinetmakers to produce objects, most of which he designed himself, for display in his London home. His mansion on Duchess Street became a showplace visited by art lovers and professional architects who took inspiration from his work.</p>\n<p>Of all the forms illustrated in Hope’s influential book, seating received the most attention. This chair, originally intended for use in a room containing Classical vases, is based on the saber-legged <em>klismos</em>, an ancient Greek form. Its idiosyncratic profile, with the exaggerated concave/convex shapes of the vertical stiles, might well have been inspired by the chairs depicted on the pots that sat on the shelves directly above it.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>William Burges was one of the preeminent architect-designers of the 19th-century Gothic Revival. The patterns and designs on this cabinet draw inspiration from the tracery and stained glass of Gothic cathedrals, as well as medieval manuscript illumination.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the reverent approach of fellow archictect-designer Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, Burges’s interpretation of the Middle Ages is more playful and humorous. The scenes on the cabinet’s four projecting panels are painted in brilliant colors and an abundance of gold by Nathaniel Westlake. They illustrate a 14th-century French poem called “Le Martyre de Saint Bacchus” (The Martyrdom of Saint Bacchus). In a witty parody of the lives of the saints, the anonymous poet contended that healing the sick and consoling the unfortunate are not just the stuff of sainthood, but the work of wine as well.</p>\n<p>On the sideboard, Saint Bacchus is depicted as a handsome young man dressed in a pink medieval-style tunic, a crown of grapevines around his head. After offering wine to his companions, he is pushed into a cask; the fourth panel shows the martyred Bacchus imprisoned in an oak wine barrel from which a maiden fills her pitcher. In the row of portraits below the scene, wine is also rendered with a human face: at far left, Burgundy is personified by a crowned, dark-haired prince, while at far right Champagne is represented as a fair-haired maiden. The inside surfaces of the two center doors, are however, painted with heads representing Temperance and Sobriety—a reminder to the cabinet’s owner to moderate his pleasures even as he pursues them.</p>\n",
